Hello!

Welcome to the email password redacter. This program takes a text file
of emails along with their passwords and will redact the password.
It uses sys.argv so you will input 

python email_password_redactor <filename> <email type>

The program will search through the file for the type of email you
input whether it is gmail, yahoo, or terpmail
and will hide the passwords for those emails.
